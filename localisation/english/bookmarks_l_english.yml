 EUROMAIDAN_DESC:0 "2013 was a turning point for Ukraine. People took to the streets of Kiev, demanding a European future. “Euromaidan” united millions hungry for change, but it also divided the country. A drama unfolded in the center of Europe that will change the balance of power on the continent. What will be your path?"

 UKR_EC_DESC:0 "The year 2013 was a testing time for Ukraine. Mass protests in the capital and major cities have sharpened the contradictions within the country. Ukraine's east and west are increasingly divided, and the leadership is torn between promises of integration with the European Union and close ties with Russia.Ukraine is a key link in the struggle for influence between the world's major powers. Can it maintain its sovereignty and unity? Will the choice be made in favor of Europe, the East, or will the country become a new player defending its own interests? Your task is to find a way through these turbulent times."
 RUS_EC_DESC:0 "The year 2013 was marked by the beginning of the political crisis in neighboring Ukraine, which threatens to destroy the old order. For Russia, this is not just an internal affair of another state, but a strategic challenge. Losing influence over Ukraine could weaken Russia's position on the international stage and undermine its credibility among its allies. As the Euromaidan protests gain momentum, the Kremlin faces a difficult choice: increase economic and diplomatic pressure to bring Ukraine back into its orbit, or go to the extreme, risking open conflict. In addition, domestic problems - from a stagnant economy to growing popular discontent - demand attention."
