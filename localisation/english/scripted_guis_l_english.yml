 maidan_description:0 "Thousands of Ukrainians gathered in the capital's main square to protest the government's decision to suspend Ukraine's integration with the European Union. The protests began as a peaceful rally for European choice, but quickly grew into a nationwide movement that sought to put an end to a corrupt regime that put its own interests above those of the people."

While Kyiv and the western regions celebrated the victory of the Revolution of Dignity, the eastern regions of the country, particularly Donbas and Crimea, found themselves at the center of a political crisis."

 get_dpr_independence_war_description:0 "The war for the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic began for us as a struggle for the right to live in a world where our language, culture and history are respected. After the events of Euromaidan, we realized that the central authorities of Ukraine have stopped hearing their people. Neglect of our interests, bans on the use of the Russian language and attempts to impose values alien to us have become the last straw."

 startup_info_ukraine_desc: "By November 21, 2013, Ukraine was in a state of tense anticipation related to its foreign policy choices. The country was on the verge of a key decision to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union, which was to take place at a summit in Vilnius in late November. However, internal and external factors created intense pressure on the country's leadership. \nPresident Viktor Yanukovych and his government, in power since 2010, tried to maneuver between two major forces - the European Union and the Russian Federation. On the one hand, a significant part of Ukrainian society, especially in the western and central regions, supported European integration as a way to modernize the country and improve life. On the other hand, Russia exerted powerful economic and political pressure to keep Ukraine in its orbit of influence. \nAgainst the backdrop of these contradictions, the Yanukovych government decided on November 21, 2013 to suspend the process of preparation for signing an agreement with the EU. This step was explained by the need to strengthen trade relations with Russia and reduce economic risks. However, for many citizens, this decision became a symbol of rejection of the European path of development. \nOn the same day, the first peaceful protests began in Kyiv, which later became known as Euromaidan. People gathered on Maidan Nezalezhnosti to express their disagreement with the government's decision. These events marked the beginning of one of the most difficult and fateful periods in the modern history of Ukraine."

 startup_info_russia_desc: "At the beginning of 2014, the Russian Federation was a powerful state with an ambitious foreign policy aimed at strengthening its influence in the post-Soviet space. Ukraine, due to its strategic geographical location, historical ties and close economic relations with Russia, occupied a key place in the Kremlin's political and geopolitical plans. \nUkraine was of particular importance for Russia as its closest neighbor and one of its largest trading partners. Close cooperation in industry, energy, and the military-industrial complex was an important factor in bilateral relations. Ukraine's gas transportation system was vital for Russian gas exports to Europe, providing a significant portion of Russia's revenues. Should we intervene in the Euromaidan events to maintain our influence in eastern Europe?"
