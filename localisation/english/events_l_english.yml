news.2.t: "Poroshenko wins in Ukraine"
news.2.d: "In the 2014 early presidential election in Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko won a landslide victory with 54.7 percent of the vote in the first round. His election campaign, centered on promises to intensify the fight against oligarchs and not to negotiate with separatists in Donbas, ensured him widespread support among Ukrainians. An additional success factor was the withdrawal of his candidacy in his favor by popular politician Vitali Klitschko. International observers representing the OSCE, PACE, EU and NATO confirmed that the elections were fair and without significant violations. Despite tense relations between the countries, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he “respects the choice of the Ukrainian people”, effectively recognizing the legitimacy of Poroshenko's victory. "

news.3.t: "Timoshenko wins in Ukraine"
news.3.d: "In Ukraine's early elections in 2014, Yulia Tymoshenko managed to win the second round with 52.89% of the vote against Petro Poroshenko's 47.11%. Her success was made possible by the consolidation of pro-European forces: candidates Tyahnybok, Hrytsenko and Bogomolets withdrew their candidacies in her favor. Poroshenko's declining popularity, caused by accusations of ties to oligarchs in the media and the lack of concrete steps in his electoral program, also played a rather important role. Tymoshenko presented a detailed anti-crisis program that attracted broad voter support. Poroshenko admitted his defeat and sent congratulations to Yulia Vladimirovna, while international observers (OSCE, PACE, EU, NATO) confirmed the transparency and fairness of the election. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he “respects the choice of the Ukrainian people”, thus effectively recognizing Tymoshenko's victory."
news.3.a: "This is a chance for Ukraine's European integration!"

news.4.t: "Minsk agreements"
news.4.d: "After intense negotiations, the tripartite contact group, including the OSCE, Ukraine and Russia, has reached an agreement, known as the Minsk Protocol, on a cease-fire. As part of the agreement, which entered into force today, the parties agreed to a bilateral cessation of the use of weapons, which will be monitored by the OSCE. All hostages are to be released, and Ukraine adopts a law that guarantees that participants in the events in Donbass will not be prosecuted or punished for their actions. In turn, the self-proclaimed DNR and LNR pledge to gradually reintegrate into Ukraine, while being granted special status. Various experts say that the agreement does give a chance for a complete cessation of hostilities and stabilization of the situation in Donbas."
news.4.a: "An important step towards de-escalation of the conflict."
news.4.u: "A fragile peace has prevailed in the Donbass...."
news.4.r: "This is just the first step toward peace"

news.5.t: "Minsk agreements fails!"
news.5.d: "After several months of relative calm since the signing of the Minsk agreement, the situation in Donbas has escalated rapidly. Today, representatives of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic announced their unilateral withdrawal from the ceasefire, and an active separatist offensive is already under way. Fighting has resumed in several key areas, including Donetsk airport, where Ukrainian forces were almost completely knocked out after almost 10 months of fierce fighting. An offensive on the strategically important Debaltseve has also begun. According to the UN, more than a thousand people have been killed in the conflict zone since November 2014, after the ceasefire was declared. In the light of these events, it becomes obvious that the Minsk agreements have not kept their promise of a peaceful settlement, and their failure can already be stated."
news.5.a: "War again?"
news.5.u: "We condemn the aggressive actions of the separatists."
news.5.r: "The AFU constantly violated the ceasefire regime!"

news.6.t: "Second Minsk agreements"
news.6.d: "Following the separatists strategic victory in the Debaltseve area, which was achieved with direct military support from Russia, the tripartite contact group comprised of the OSCE, Ukraine, and Russia was forced to sign a new Package of Measures to implement the Minsk agreements. These arrangements, referred to in the media as the Second Minsk Agreements, represent a significant concession on the part of Ukraine, which was forced to agree to terms that clearly favor Russia. The separatists actually gained additional advantages, and Ukraine was put under serious pressure given the military situation. Many experts and political figures believe that in the context of the ongoing war and with the loss of key positions, Ukraine signed these agreements to avoid even greater losses of both territory and military personnel."
news.6.a: "A bad peace is always better than a good quarrel"
news.6.u: "We had no other choice..."
news.6.r: "The long-awaited peace... on our terms."

news.7.t: "Yanukovich overthrow"
news.7.d: "On February 21, 2014, amid bloody clashes on Maidan in which more than a hundred people were killed, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and leaders of the parliamentary opposition signed an agreement prescribing a return to a parliamentary-presidential form of government, the establishment of a “government of national confidence,” and early elections. However, protesters on Maidan demanded Yanukovych's immediate resignation, setting an ultimatum until 10 a.m. on Feb. 22. Without waiting for the deadline to expire, the activists seized the government quarter, which was abandoned by law enforcers. On the same day, the Verkhovna Rada announced that Yanukovych had left Kiev and later recognized his self-removal from power and called early elections. Yanukovych, who left the capital, briefly moved to Kharkiv, but later left for Russia via Crimea, where he is believed to be now."

news.7.u: "Slava Ukraini!"
news.7.r: "We do not recognize this coup!"

news.8.t: "“Green Mens in the Crimea.”"
news.8.d: "Since February 27, 2014, armed individuals wearing Russian military uniforms and carrying Russian weapons, but without identifying marks, began to appear in Crimea. These unknown armed forces seized important facilities, including the buildings of the Supreme Council and the Council of Ministers in Simferopol. Roadblocks set up on the Perekop Isthmus and Chongar Peninsula cut off Crimea's land connection to mainland Ukraine. At the same time, “green men” appeared in Sevastopol and Simferopol and seized the parliament and government buildings. They presented themselves as local self-defence groups or members of various Cossack organizations. In response to these events, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated a policy of non-interference in Ukrainian affairs, and Vladimir Putin ordered military exercises. Despite the obvious involvement, Russia continues to deny any ties to the events in Crimea. Ukrainian, European and U.S. government officials, meanwhile, claim that the “green men” are none other than soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces."
news.8.a: "This is a clear threat to the territorial integrity of Ukraine"
news.8.u: "We demand the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Crimea!"
news.8.r: "Our servicemen are not in Crimea!"

news.9.t: "Russian annexation of Crimea"
news.9.d: "On February 27, 2014, a session of the Supreme Council was held in the building of the parliament of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which was seized by “green men”, where a new government was formed, recognized only by Russia. The government was headed by Sergei Aksyonov, leader of the Russian Unity party. On March 1, Aksyonov asked Russian President Vladimir Putin for military assistance to “maintain peace” in Crimea, which became the basis for Russia's military intervention. Putin received approval from the Federation Council to use Russian armed forces abroad. Russian troops and Crimean self-defense units soon blockaded all Ukrainian military installations on the peninsula, and an ultimatum was issued to the Ukrainian military to surrender. On March 6, the Supreme Council of Crimea, de facto controlled by Russia, announced that a referendum would be held on March 16 on the future status of Crimea. The results of the referendum, in which an overwhelming majority (96.57% with a turnout of 84.17%) voted in favor of joining Russia, became the basis for the signing of a treaty between the Russian Federation and the self-proclaimed Republic of Crimea on March 18. The annexation process was finally completed on March 21, when the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol became subjects of the Russian Federation. The referendum is considered by experts as a sham - it was not attended by international observers and the press was censored. Crimean Tatars, the indigenous people of Crimea, boycotted the vote. By March 28, all remaining Ukrainian military personnel had been withdrawn from the peninsula."
news.9.a: "We strongly condemn the illegal annexation of Crimea."

news.10.t: "Fall of Donetsk Airport"
news.10.d: "After hundreds days of fierce fighting, Donetsk International Airport, once a symbol of modern Ukraine, fell under the onslaught of armed formations. The heroism of the defenders, nicknamed “cyborgs,” became legendary, but the forces were unequal. Destroyed terminals and ruined runways now symbolize the brutality of war. The impact of these events is felt not only on the battlefield, but also on the morale of the population and the political situation in the region."

news.12.d: "Mariupol, an important industrial and strategic center, became the scene of fierce fighting.

donetsk.1.d: "Amid an escalating political crisis caused by protests and armed confrontation in Donetsk oblast, the Donetsk People's Republic was proclaimed. The leaders of the protest movement declared the independence of the region, stating that the results of the referendum on self-determination gave them full right to do so. The declaration of independence became the starting point for further escalation of the conflict, which rapidly turned into war. The Ukrainian government refused to recognize the republic, and the international community was split in its assessment of what was happening. How will events develop further? It is up to you to decide."
