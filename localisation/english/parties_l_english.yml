 liberalism:0 "Liberalism"
 liberalism_desc:0 "Liberal democracy upholds individual liberty, the rule of law and human rights as the core values of the state. It prioritizes the protection of free elections, the independence of the judiciary and the press. Such an arrangement presupposes minimal state interference in the personal and economic lives of citizens. Liberal democracy seeks a balance between individual liberty and the public good, while actively supporting globalism, expanded human rights, and progressivism."

 conservatism:0 "Conservatism"
 conservatism_desc:0 "Conservative democracy combines both a commitment to democratic principles and respect for traditional values such as family, religion and order. It is an ideology aimed at preserving the foundations of society, strengthening national sovereignty and stability through gradual, slow and careful reform rather than radical change. It supports a strong state and emphasizes the role of common historical and cultural roots."

 social_democracy:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_desc:0 "Social democracy seeks to create an equal society through a combination of a market economy and strong social guarantees. The basic idea is to redistribute wealth to reduce economic inequality and ensure decent conditions for all. Social democrats advocate progressive taxation, affordable health care and education, as well as the protection of labor rights and, often, the ecological environment."

 communistic:0 "Communism"
 communistic_desc:0 "Communism proclaims the ideal of a classless society in which the means of production belong to all the people and resources are distributed according to need. This ideology rejects private property and the market economy, replacing them with centralized planning. Communism proposes a radical transformation of society, often through revolution, and emphasizes the struggle of the working class against exploitation."

 socialistic:0 "Socialism"
 socialistic_desc:0 "Socialism is an ideology that seeks social justice and equality by strengthening the role of the state in the economy. Some individual market mechanisms are allowed to remain, but all key industries and resources are controlled by the state. Socialism advocates the availability of basic goods, social services and against excessive concentration of capital in the hands of certain groups. Socialism is often a stage preceding communism."

 nationalistic:0 "Nationalism"
 nationalistic_desc:0 "Nationalism emphasizes the interests of one's own people and the desire to strengthen national identity. It can take many forms, from cultural unity and civic nationalism to radical, aggressive superiority of one nationality (or ethnic group) over another. This ideology often puts the interests of the state above international cooperation and promotes the ideas of protecting sovereignty, national (sovereign) economy and territorial integrity."

 fascism_ideology:0 "Fascism"
 fascism_ideology_desc:0 "Fascism is a radical totalitarian ideology that rejects democracy and liberalism in favor of total state control over citizens in all spheres of life. It is based on the cult of personality (leaderism), militarism and radical nationalism. Fascism emphasizes the strength of national unity through the suppression of dissent, rigid social hierarchy and aggressive foreign policy, which is usually oriented toward territorial expansion."

 autoritarian_democractic:0 "Authoritarian Democracy"
 autoritarian_democractic_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is a compromise between elements of democracy and rigid centralized governance. It preserves elections (which, however, are almost always rigged and are only necessary to create the appearance of democracy) and the principles of separation of powers, but opposition is restricted and the rights and freedoms of citizens are often suppressed in order to maintain order and control. This system provides stability, but at the cost of political freedoms and social diversity. Often authoritarian democracy leads to the emergence of populist (most often centrist and apolitical) dictatorships."
