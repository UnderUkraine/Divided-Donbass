 UKR_Yanukovich_rule: "Yanukovich rule"
 UKR_Yanukovich_rule_desc: "Yanukovych's rule has been characterized as a time of hope and hidden threats. Promises of economic growth and modernization go hand in hand with increased control over society. The only question is whether the leader will be able to live up to expectations or whether his course will lead to political collapse."
 UKR_Eurointegration: "Eurointegration?"
 UKR_Eurointegration_desc: "The pursuit of integration with the European Union opens new horizons of economic development and democratic reforms for the country. An association agreement with the EU promises significant benefits, including access to European markets and technology. However, the pro-European course causes deep divisions in society and strong pressure from Russia, which is not interested in our rapprochement with the West"
 UKR_Decline_to_sign_agreement: "Decline to sign agreement"
 UKR_Decline_to_sign_agreement_desc: "After long negotiations and public statements about readiness for European integration, the country's leadership suddenly decided to refuse to sign an agreement with the EU. This step caused mixed reactions: some see it as a defense of national interests and sovereignty, while others see it as a betrayal of the dream of a European future. How will this decision turn out for the country?"
 UKR_Protests_on_streets: "Protests on streets"
 UKR_Protests_on_streets_desc: "The refusal to sign the agreement with the European Union has become the spark that ignites the flames of public discontent. Thousands of people took to the streets, demanding a revision of the decision and the resignation of the leadership. The protests are gaining momentum, leading to destabilization in the country. Will the authorities be able to maintain control, or will this crisis be the beginning of the end of the existing regime?"
 UKR_Stop_protesters: "Stop protesters"
 UKR_Stop_protesters_desc: "Protests in the streets threaten the stability of the State. The leadership decides on tough measures to restore order. The police and special services are ordered to disperse the demonstrations at any cost. This step can regain control of the situation, but is fraught with internal conflicts and a sharp deterioration in relations with the international community."

 UKR_anarchy_in_goverment: "Anarchy in government!"
 UKR_anarchy_in_goverment_desc: "Since the overthrow of Ukrainian dictator Viktor Yanukovych, our country has experienced a power vacuum and a serious governance crisis. Scattered political forces, from reformers to radicals, are seeking to seize control, taking advantage of the instability of the state. Meanwhile, cells of “Russian peace” supporters are beginning to form in the southeast, threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity. The economy is teetering on the brink of collapse, and chaos continues to grow. We urgently need to coordinate our efforts with others in power to restore order. Otherwise, we risk losing control of the situation and finding ourselves in a situation of civil war."
 UKR_coalition_in_rada: "Coalition in the Verkhovna Rada"
 UKR_coalition_in_rada_desc: "Now that the will of the people has been realized, our priority is to form a new majority in the Verkhovna Rada. The creation of a coalition government capable of ensuring a stable and reliable system of governance is essential to prevent counter-revolution and the return of Yanukovych's people to power. Only through the combined efforts of all political parties will we be able to lay the foundation for building a new, democratic and strong Ukraine!"
 UKR_destability_on_east: "Destability on east"
 UKR_destability_on_east_desc: "The events of the Revolution of Dignity have caused sharp discontent among the residents of the eastern regions of Ukraine, where Anti-Maidan activists have begun to oppose our authorities. Every day the situation in the southeast is becoming more and more threatening. In Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions, separatist sentiments are developing into open resistance supported by external forces. Armed groups are seizing administrative buildings, and Russian flags are becoming the banner of the radicals. We must immediately develop a plan of action to stabilize the regions, whether through negotiations or the suppression of traitors by force."
 UKR_appel_the_un: "Appel the UN"
 UKR_appel_the_un_desc: "The overthrow of Yanukovych and the subsequent leadership crisis have led to growing threats to Ukraine's national security. Separatist sentiments in the East are on the rise, and hostile external forces are actively interfering in our internal affairs. To preserve our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we must seek support from the international community, particularly the United Nations. The UN will provide us with diplomatic and humanitarian assistance and help us prevent the escalation of civil conflict in the East, won't it?"
