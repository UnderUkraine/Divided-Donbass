 UKR_anarchy_in_goverment: "Anarchy in the Government!"
 UKR_anarchy_in_goverment_desc: "Since the overthrow of Ukrainian dictator Viktor Yanukovych, our country has experienced a power vacuum and a serious governance crisis. Scattered political forces, from reformers to radicals, are seeking to seize control, taking advantage of the instability of the state. Meanwhile, cells of “Russian peace” supporters are beginning to form in the southeast, threatening Ukraine's territorial integrity. The economy is teetering on the brink of collapse, and chaos continues to grow. We urgently need to coordinate our efforts with others in power to restore order. Otherwise, we risk losing control of the situation and finding ourselves in a situation of civil war."
 UKR_coalition_in_rada: "Coalition in the Verkhovna Rada"
 UKR_coalition_in_rada_desc: "Now that the will of the people has been realized, our priority is to form a new majority in the Verkhovna Rada. The creation of a coalition government capable of ensuring a stable and reliable system of governance is essential to prevent counter-revolution and the return of Yanukovych's people to power. Only through the combined efforts of all political parties will we be able to lay the foundation for building a new, democratic and strong Ukraine!"

 UKR_destability_on_east_desc: "The events of the Revolution of Dignity have caused sharp discontent among the residents of the eastern regions of Ukraine, where Anti-Maidan activists have begun to oppose our authorities. Every day the situation in the southeast is becoming more and more threatening. In Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions, separatist sentiments are developing into open resistance supported by external forces. Armed groups are seizing administrative buildings, and Russian flags are becoming the banner of the radicals. We must immediately develop a plan of action to stabilize the regions, whether through negotiations or the suppression of traitors by force."

 UKR_appel_the_un_desc: "The overthrow of Yanukovych and the subsequent leadership crisis have led to growing threats to Ukraine's national security. Separatist sentiments in the East are on the rise, and hostile external forces are actively interfering in our internal affairs. To preserve our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we must seek support from the international community, particularly the United Nations. The UN will provide us with diplomatic and humanitarian assistance and help us prevent the escalation of civil conflict in the East, won't it?"
